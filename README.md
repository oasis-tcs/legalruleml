<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/">OASIS LegalRuleML TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/legalruleml">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/legalruleml</a> ) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS TC Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this GitHub repository is to develop and distribute good examples in order to share knowledge about the correct application of <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalruleml/legalruleml-core-spec/v1.0/">LegalRuleML</a> standard. The objective of the LegalRuleML TC is to extend <a href="http://wiki.ruleml.org/">RuleML</a> with formal features specific to legal norms, guidelines, policies, and reasoning. The TC defines a standard (expressed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)">W3C XML-schema</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG">Relax NG</a>) that is able to represent the particularities of the legal normative rules with a rich, articulated, and meaningful markup language.</p>

<p>
LegalRuleML should be used for as an intermediate language between norms/textual provisions and logical implementations of the norms/textual provisions. Ideally, a LegalRuleML serialisation of norms/textual provisions should be conceptual, in the sense that the representation is neutral (see examples at 
<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalruleml/legalruleml-core-spec/v1.0/cs02/examples/">this link</a>) and independent of any particular logic formalism or system for legal reasoning or implementation instructions. However, it is possible to write conformant LegalRuleML that is specific to a particular Logic.<br>
The use cases below provide examples of conformant serialisation.

<ul>
  <li><b>Use Case #1</b>: The use case serialises <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">GDPR</a>, artt. 5(1)(a), 6(1)(a), 8(1), 12(7), using 
    reified Input/Output logic <a href="https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/27/8/2471/3098296?redirectedFrom=fulltext">[Robaldo and Sun, 2017]</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Use Case #2</b>: The use case serialises...</li>
  <li><b>Use Case #3</b> C</li>
  <li><b>Etc.</b></li>
</ul>
